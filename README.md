# 📱 Mobile User Churn Prediction (Streamlit)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a mobile app user is likely to churn based on user engagement, activity patterns, and behavioral features.

The goal is to identify inactive users early so businesses can improve retention strategies and reduce customer churn.

## 🔥 Project Highlights

* Large-scale dataset (1M+ sample from 19M rows)
* Feature engineering using user-level aggregation
* Time-based churn labeling (inactive for last 30 days)
* Machine Learning model training & evaluation
* Interactive Streamlit web application for predictions

---

## 📂 Dataset Information

* Original dataset size: **19 million+ rows**
* Sample used for training: **1 million+ rows**
